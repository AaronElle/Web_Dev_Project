<h2>Exploring how AI-assisted coding is transforming web development.</h2>
<div style="margin-right: 400px; text-indent: 40px;"><h2>AI has become a useful tool in the development process of software programming. Through its automation procedures, it can accelerate programming work like no other innovation that has ever been made. As useful as an AI companion can be, there are still concerns raised on ethical and technical problems that can occur. Purely relying on AI for Web Development can create vulnerabilities in the code via poor code quality, as well as privacy risks for any user logging into the AI-made site. The best way to use AI for software programming is to use it as a helpful tool. </h2>
</div>

<h2>Will AI replace web developers?</h2>
<div style="margin-right: 400px; text-indent: 40px;"><h2>The short answer is no. As advances AI has proven to be, it still lacks the capacity for problem-solving capabilities that are valued in competent software-programmers, for all of its autonomy in program construction. The best way to take advantage of AI in building code is to use it as a helpful tool!</h2></div>

<h2>The Risks of Using AI</h2>
<div style="margin-right: 400px; text-indent: 40px;"><h2>1.)  Malicious Use: The tool that is AI could easily be taken advantage of for the sake of harming and deceiving others! The ways it could be abused include producing harmful propaganda, using it for surveillance, forcing it to ensure censorship, the list is endless!</h2>
    <h2> 2.) AI Race: We have already witnessed the consequences of AI advancement by the top companies building water and electricity hungry data centers throughout the nation, disrupting the local environments and utility bills of local home owners in those areas. Further want for AI growth will lead more companies and nations to rush AI development for the worst reasons, such as cyberwarfare and autonomous weapons!</h2>
    <h2>  3.) Organizational Risks: In regards to companies' self interest, there is a valid risk that oversight inspired by profits could lead to undermining the safety of their employees. Internal/outside leaks could occur leading to the failure of companies to deliver.</h2>
    <h2>   4.) Rogue AIs: As AI grows and evolves, it becomes more probable that people lose control of what AI can learn and control. AI could learn to focus on harmful objectives, become proactive in deceiving people in what they believe that can control in the AIs' programming. It is disturbing to consider there risks, considering how the military is giving their own AI bots military devices...</h2></div>
